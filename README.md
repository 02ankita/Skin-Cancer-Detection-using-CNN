# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. The goal is to classify lesions into cancerous and non-cancerous categories to assist early screening and clinical decision-making. By leveraging deep learning, the model learns discriminative visual features directly from image data without manual feature engineering.

The workflow includes image preprocessing, dataset balancing, model training, validation, and performance evaluation. Metrics such as accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices are used to assess model performance. This approach demonstrates the potential of deep learning models to support dermatology automation and medical image analysis.
